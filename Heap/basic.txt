A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. 
Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

1) Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

2)Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
